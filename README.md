the same as https://github.com/Spicadox/TwitCastingDownloader , except it automatically converts all the downloaded mp4 files into .opus<br>
you must have:<br>
-every req from here: https://github.com/Spicadox/TwitCastingDownloader<br>
-send2trash installed (pip install it)<br>
-ffmpeg (in PATH)<br>
loops over all the mp4s in a directory, converts them one at a time to .opus and then sends them to the trash can. you can obviously just replace the send2trash part with something to delete them outright.<br>
i made this because mp4s are too heavy and i dont have a lot of space 以上だ<br>
(ive not tested this as a script, i just run the program from vscode, so it might not work as a script idk, if it doesnt work 適当に fix it)
